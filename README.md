# OpenProducer
[OpenProducer](https://www.openproducer.org) is a collective of like-minded developers, designers, producers, educators, and innovators who provide media producers and community members access to open tools, knowledge, and opportunities that empower them to create their best work. 

## We do this in the following ways
- Contribute towards open source tools for radio stations, podcasters, videomakers, musicians, and others who produce.
- Build and run hands-on training to create community media using industry-accepted open source technologies.
- Connect individuals and organizations with similar goals and interests to collectively support and fund open projects and programs.

## Projects
We contribute towards the following open source projects:
- [AzuraCast](https://www.azuracast.com/) is a self-hosted, all-in-one web radio management suite.
- [LibreTime](https://libretime.org/) is open broadcast software for scheduling and remote station management.
- [Radio Station](https://wordpress.org/plugins/radio-station/) is a plugin to build and manage a Show Schedule for a radio station or internet broadcasterâ€™s WordPress website.
- [OpenProducer](https://www.openproducer.org/projects/openproducer-platform/) is a platform that enables and empowers musicians, media makers, broadcasters, publishers, and others who produce.
- [Newspack](https://newspack.pub/) is an open-source publishing platform built on WordPress for small to medium sized news organizations. 

## What we need
- Contributors ranging from project manager, content editor, developer, designer, to multimedia production, event coordinator, business development, and fundraiser. 
- Collaboration with other projects, organizations, and groups interested in creating open tools and opportunities for producers and creative communities.
